. we can define jaccard as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union
 of two label sets. If the entire set of predicted labels for a sample strictly match with 
 the true set of labels, then the subset accuracy is 1.0; otherwise it is 0.

"""Confusion Matrix Evaluation
Look at first row. The first row is for customers whose actual churn value in test set is 1.
 As you can calculate, out of 40 customers, the churn value of 15 of them is 1. And out of these 15,
 the classifier correctly predicted 6 of them as 1, and 9 of them as 0.

It means, for 6 customers, the actual churn value were 1 in test set, and classifier 
also correctly predicted those as 1. However, while the actual label of 9 customers were 1,
 the classifier predicted those as 0, which is not very good. We can consider it 
 as error of the model for first row.

What about the customers with churn value 0? Lets look at the second row. 
It looks like there were 25 customers whom their churn value were 0.

The classifier correctly predicted 24 of them as 0, and one of them wrongly as 1. 
So, it has done a good job in predicting the customers with churn value 0. 
A good thing about confusion matrix is that shows the modelâ€™s ability to correctly
 predict or separate the classes. In specific case of binary classifier, 
 such as this example, we can interpret these numbers as the count of true positives,
 false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
